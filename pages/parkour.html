        <p class="a1">We had this minigame a few years back. We did but now it's gone. But wait, it's coming back? That's right, the minigame that
            so many people love is coming back and is going to be even better. Parkour! Parkour is an obstacle course type minigame where you jump from
            block to block without falling down into lava or into the deadly void.
        </p>

        <p class="a2" style="padding-bottom: 130px; padding-top: 0;">Type <b>/warp parkour</b> to join parkour in Blockpro. This minigame is
            singleplayer compatible so you are able to play this when no one is online! This minigame is currently under construction, so we
            are not ready really ready to publish it yet but, you are able to access Parkour by the warp given above. Players are even able to
            build their own parkour maps in a certian world and if it is approved, we will publish it to the server! Btw you can build your own
            parkour even in creative plots.

        <p>Watch your step!</p>

        <p>Players can come on and build a parkour map on a certian world, but it must be spaced out from other parkour builds or it won't be accepted into the minigame.</p>
