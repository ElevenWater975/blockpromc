        <p>Welcome to Zombies. In this gamemode, you go against countless amounts of monsters. Each wave is harder than the last. This minigame is
            singleplayer compatible, but it is recommended you play with a friend. With traps, chests, secrets, and unlockable items, you and your
            friends, can survive the horde. The final boss is the hardest wave.</p>
            <p>The final boss is the hardest wave out of all waves. On top of the countless amount of monsters going after you, you have a high health
            boss as well. This boss is usually either a Wither Skeleton, Piglin Brute, or a Wither (Coming soon). The final boss is one of the reasons of the
            reasons why you should bring a friend when you play. But, if you have a good amount of items and powerful loot, you alone can beat the boss
            without problem. Choose your strategy and fight for your lives.

        <p>Look for the secrets. They may give you some OP item.</p>
        <p>On the map "remgladiators", complete the cobblestone parkour to earn the grappling hook. You might need it at some point.</p>
        <p>Use your earned items from the class "my-items" to craft something great. You may need to use them to beat the boss.</p>

        <p>Fact: Yes, our new map coming out called "Yaril" is inspired by the video game "DOOM".</p>
