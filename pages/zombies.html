        <p>Welcome to Zombies. In this gamemode, you go against countless amounts of monsters. Each wave is harder than the last. This minigame is
            singleplayer compatible, but it is recommended you play with a friend. With traps, chests, secrets, and unlockable items, you and your
            friends, can survive the horde. The final boss is the hardest wave.</p>
            <p>The final boss is the hardest wave out of all waves. On top of the countless amount of monsters going after you, you have a high health
            boss as well. This boss is usually either a Wither Skeleton, Piglin Brute, or a Wither (Coming soon). The final boss is one of the reasons of the
            reasons why you should bring a friend when you play. But, if you have a good amount of items and powerful loot, you alone can beat the boss
            without problem. Choose your strategy and fight for your lives.

        <h1>Tips and Tricks:</h1>

        <br>
        <p>Look for secret items. Some weapons are buyable, some are not. Find loot chests, and choose the right class. We recommend "knight"</p>
        <p>Do not let Entity_303's influence capture you! Look for clues around BlockPro to uncover the zombies storyline.</p>
        <p>Don't go in alone unless you're a daredevil or a professional. These zombies are super fast and will tear you apart if you're not careful.</p>
        <p>Use the crafting stations to create your own items and become stronger than ever.</p>
        <p>Mob deaths drop in-game currency and points which are used to buy weapons and buy items in the crafting stations shops.</p>
