        <p>Want to join a public BlockPro discussion channel? Join our Discord server. On this serve, you can talk about anything BlockPro
            related (There is an off-topic channel though.). We are posting announcements more often on the server and a lot of them are about
            the new <a href="https://blockpromc.netlify.app/pages/zombies"> Zombies</a> map called "Yaril". If you want to stay tuned to  
            updates and events more often, join the <a href="https://discord.gg/mKWWfPthck">discord server here.</a>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Almost all ranks that you have been given on the server will turn into roles on the Discord server. Got some art to share? Cool,
            we got an art channel. Wanna share some code? You wanna share your animation? Well that's great because we allow you to send your
            cool projects. Please, share this server with more Minecraft Java Edition players and you will find more friends to play BlockPro
            with. Join the fun! <a href="https://blockpromc.netlify.app" style="font-family: 'Minecraft', sans-serif; color: yellow">Back to home page</a>
