# blockpromc
A website I have created for a Minecraft server. This is probably one of my easiest projects and I am glad I have made this site available for everyone on desktop to use.
I used to use Enjin for creating a Minecraft server website, but I stopped. Since I know how to code in front end programming languages, I have decided to create
a website completely from scratch. This website is hosted on netlify. The url is https://blockpromc.netlify.app . The Minecraft server IP is Blockpro.serv.nu
versions 1.16.5. - 1.18.1.
